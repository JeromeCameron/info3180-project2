## Background

For this project we will create a fictional Instagram clone called
Photogram that we can share photos with our friends and family. 

## Key Functionality

You should be able to register for an account on our Photogram web
application. Once a user has an account, they should be able to login and
upload photos to their Photogram feed. Each photo, should have an image
and a caption. A user should also be able to "Like" another users posts and
also follow a user.
