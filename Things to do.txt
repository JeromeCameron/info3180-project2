#Add task here

1. Implement logout

2. Implement toggle login/logout

3. Implement toggle follow/following and button functionality to increase counter

4. MyProfile functionality for the logged in user: authenticated user's id must be passed into MyProfile component

5. Display 404 page for user id's that do not exist;
        Currently for example, the link "http://info3180-project2-jimmy876.c9users.io:8080/users/500" renders a page

6. Find a better way to send user banner data for MyProfile component; currently, if a user has no posts their banner
        will be blank. This is because the banner data is sent with each posts' data
